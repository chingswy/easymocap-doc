## FrankMocap: A Strong and Easy-to-use Single View 3D Hand+Body Pose Estimator

[code](https://github.com/facebookresearch/frankmocap)

- [Resolving 3D Human Pose Ambiguities with 3D Scene Constraints](): 有场景约束
- [ Unite the People: Closing the Loop Between 3D and 2D Human Representations](): 
- [Total Capture: A 3D Deformation Model for Tracking Faces, Hands, and Bodies](): fit到点云上
- [Video Based Reconstruction of 3D People Models](): 使用轮廓线
- [Monocular Total Capture: Posing Face, Body, and Hands in the Wild]()
- [Learning 3D Human Pose from Structure and Motion](): 引入了关节角度约束
- [Exploiting Temporal Context for 3D Human Pose Estimation in the Wild](): 使用了时序拟合
- [Lightweight Multi-person Total Motion Capture Using Sparse Multi-view Cameras](): 没有与其他方法的对比结果
